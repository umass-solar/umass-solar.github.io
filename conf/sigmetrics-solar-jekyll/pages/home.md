SIGMETRICS is the [ACM](https://www.acm.org) Special Interest Group (SIG) for the computer performance evaluation community.

SIGMETRICS promotes research in performance analysis techniques as well as the advanced and innovative use of known methods and tools. It sponsors conferences, such as its own annual conference (SIGMETRICS), whose papers appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computer Systems (POMACS). It also publishes a newsletter (Performance Evaluation Review), and operates a mailing list linking researchers, students, and practitioners interested in performance evaluation.
