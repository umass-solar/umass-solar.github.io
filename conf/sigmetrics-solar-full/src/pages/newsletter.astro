  <Section title="About PER">
    <p>
      Performance Evaluation Review is sent to SIGMETRICS members and is available through the ACM Digital Library. PER publishes
      special issues and, as space permits, regular contributions such as survey articles, position papers, tool descriptions,
      abstract collections, and early work.
    </p>

  <Section title="Submitting">
    <p class="muted">
      Regular contributions should be prepared using PER style files and typically should not exceed 10 pages (tool papers often shorter).
      Submissions are commonly emailed as PDF to the editor.
