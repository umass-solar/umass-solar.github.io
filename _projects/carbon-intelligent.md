The energy transition elevates the importance of *carbon efficiency*---the ability to do more work when and where low-carbon and clean energy is available---relative to *energy efficiency*---the ability to do the most work for the least amount of energy.  
While optimizing energy efficiency has been a focus of research for decades, optimizing carbon efficiency is new and largely under-explored. Technically speaking, optimizing carbon efficiency is more closely related to the concept of energy flexibility---the degree to which a workload can be shifted temporally or spatially---than energy efficiency. The relationship between energy flexibility and energy efficiency may conflict, i.e., increasing energy flexibility can decrease energy efficiency. For example, data centers are most energy-efficient at high utilization, so leveraging their energy flexibility to reduce carbon emissions by periodically reducing their utilization and power usage makes them less energy-efficient. 

We initiated a study to theoretically understand this tradeoff by formulating the online pause and resume problem. This is a substantial next step in our research on both energy and theory: 
* On the theory side, it is foundationally promising since it relates to online problems with long-term and switching cost constraints. 
* On the energy front, it opens the door for the next generation of sustainable computing with a focus on carbon intelligence instead of energy efficiency.
