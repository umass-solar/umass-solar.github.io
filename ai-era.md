# Research in the AI Era

Research is shifting toward a world where every lab has access to powerful, fallible, semi-autonomous research co-pilots. The challenge is to shape research culture, training, and norms so we exploit AI where it amplifies creativity, rigor, and reach—while resisting it where it erodes understanding, integrity, or equity—and keeping the human parts of research (wonder, taste, responsibility) clearly in view. In the AI era, researchers increasingly act less like “push-button scientists” and more like lab heads: designing and supervising a growing cast of non-human collaborators.

## Format & timing

- **When:** Select Fridays during the Spring 2025, immediately after the student/faculty lunch  
- **Time:** ~**1:00–2:00pm**
- **Where:** E144/A112  
- **Audience:** Faculty, students, and visitors interested in how AI is changing research practice and norms
